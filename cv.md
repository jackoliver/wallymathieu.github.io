### System developer, Tacton Systems : 2015

Did work with a medium size javascript application. This application is calculation heavy and is a good fit to take advantage of knockout (where my experience working with knockout was helpful). Have been in large parts of the client side application. Have stabilized the code enough to be able to deliver without too much regression. Has used the basic architecture of the application and enhanced it by refactoring. Has also done minor changes server side (but not as many since the other team members are more fluent in c# than javascript, thus less need for an extra hand in the c# parts).

### System developer, DGC : 2014 - 2015

Integration with an older SOAP service. Worked mainly with different older parts of different services.

Have also helped with a new systems (written in angular with a c# backend). Fixed bugs and written tests to avoid regression. Have been able to write stable code in the old systems thanks to experience applying refactorings in order to write tests.
