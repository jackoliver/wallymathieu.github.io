Ever worked with a source control system where you have single user lock on files? This interferes to much with work. You rarely want a locking mechanism in place (that would degrade the ability to work together). I have a nagging feeling that files and folders should not be locked by a single process/applikation. It interferes with many of the things I do. Just look at onenote. Instead of the easy way (locking), the program merges the changes. It's often easier to deal with the edge cases when they arise, rather than trying to avoid them altogether.</div>
