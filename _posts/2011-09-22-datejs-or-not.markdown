I've not had a need for any good date library until now. There seems to be one that most commonly used: <a href="http://code.google.com/p/datejs/">datejs</a>. The problem with this library is that it extends the native Date object. There is a relatively unknown repository on <a href="https://github.com/datejs/Datejs">github</a>Â (only a few watch and forks).
