When you are working with Cygwin, sometimes you would get an error like this:<br><i><span style="background-color: black; color: lime;">"unable to remap some.dll to same address as parentÂ someapp 4292 fork: child 3964 - died waiting for dll loading, errno 11"</span></i><br>
Then you would need to run rebaseall.<br>
In order to run it, close all you Cygwin windows. Make sure that all of the perl and cygwin processes/services are closed.<br>
Open a command prompt (windows command prompt) and go to your cygwin directory.<br>
From the root of your cygwin directory, execute <span style="background-color: black; color: white;">bin\ash.exe</span>.<br>
Ash (a unix shell) will start. Inside ash you then execute:<br><span style="background-color: black;"><span style="color: white;">bin/rebaseall</span></span><br>
Once it is done, exit and close the command prompt. If it still does not work even though you did the above: Reboot.<br><h3>
