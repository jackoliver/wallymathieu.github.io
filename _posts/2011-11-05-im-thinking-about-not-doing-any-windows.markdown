While WPF is nice and resharper + visual studio is awesome it's just to painful to develop on a remote machine.<br><br>
The alternative is to buy visual studio + windows and create a virtual machine. This feels to much like a serious investment:<br>
The cost of windows is something like 1200 skr. The cost of visual studio is about 10 000 skr.<br><br>
So I guess I will abandon the platform specific home projects. Time to try out some more scheme, python and ruby (I'm not forgetting mono)!
