There are some pitfalls for using javascript. Intellisense being one of them. Not to worry, a great starting point would be ScottGu's blogg post about <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/06/21/vs-2008-javascript-intellisense.aspx">general javascript intellisense</a> as well as his post about <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2008/11/21/jquery-intellisense-in-vs-2008.aspx">jquery intellisense</a>. The nice thing is that you can get the yellow documentation hover for your own scripts as can be seen in Scotts first post.
