There shouldn't be so much of a debate. I thought that ruby had better string handling until I found out that in python 3 the unicode issue is fixed. The languages are strikingly similar in some aspects, as they are different in others. There are lessons from each of these languages. In python I've seen beautiful and readable short programs. In ruby I've seen beautiful and well structured programs. I only know a little about each of these languages (but I think that I've been helped by learning them).
