Sounds interesting to hear about the new WinRT api:s for windows. Reading up on it WinRT are COM objects in contrast to the Win32 architecture.<br>
One of the exciting things about this is the promise of being able to use xaml in c++.<br><br>
An overview of WinRT by Marius Bancila:<br><a href="http://mariusbancila.ro/blog/2011/09/15/windows-runtime/">Windows Runtime</a><br><br>
It's quite interesting to read the list on Msdn:<br><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/hh464945(v=VS.85).aspx">Windows Runtime and the Windows API</a><br><br>
Right now it's probably to early to get a good idea of how everything will look and exactly what features will be accessible for Metro style apps.<br><br>
Replacing the Win32 api:s is probably an overstatement. I would guess that for some things you might be forced to use older api:s.
