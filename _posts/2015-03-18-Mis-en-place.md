When writing code what do you need to have in place in order to be able to receive new feature requests and deliver them?

For me the answer is 
A map of the domain (usually based on the db, can be from a [tool](https://github.com/wallymathieu/mejram) or from [database diagram](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms178084.aspx) )

## An understanding of the code structure.

## necessary infrastructure
The code infrastructe (for instance how to interact with persistant storage)
The release infrastructure 
Test infrastructure (nunit, xunit, how to setup test data)
