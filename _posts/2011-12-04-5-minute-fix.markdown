Sometimes, instead of learning something, I will just search stackoverflow. When I've been using stackoverflow much, I'm feeling stupid. I'm not learning anything. For instance: I've been having some troubles grasping knockout. The problem have been that I've been surfing to stackoverflow for a quick fix instead of taking time to read the knockout documentation. It's such an easy way out that I'm seriously considering to only use it when I really need it.
