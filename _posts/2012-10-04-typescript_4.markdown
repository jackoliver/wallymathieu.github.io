Why is Typescript more interesting than coffeescript and similar constructs? Typescript is an extension of the javascript language. If you avoid the syntactic sugar for classes and modules in typescript, but it still can be very helpful (perhaps a sweet addition to jshint). It avoids the <a href="http://ryanflorence.com/2011/case-against-coffeescript/">assembler of the web</a> problems.<br><br>
I don't agree with the reasoning about the reasoning about write large applications. It would be horrible if you write javascript and avoid writing good code and instead use the type system as a crutch (as can be seen in some c# and java projects).<br><br>
Also, you don't need a static type system as <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/posts/Anders-Hejlsberg-Introducing-TypeScript#c634847050528845048">Derick Bailey points out</a> to get excellent tooling.
