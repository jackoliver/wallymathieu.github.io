The more I think about the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/br229512">metro style</a>, it sounds really revolutionary for microsoft design. I've started looking at how the new windows phone style looks. It looks more modern than the other themes for smart phones. Probably because it's not been used as much.<br><br>
I feel that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Aero">windows aero</a>Â was to bloated in visual space. It looks sweet on a machine with high enough resolution and screen space, but looks to bulky on other things. The default margins take to much space. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_XP_themes#Windows_Classic_theme">classic gray theme</a> has been my preferred theme when working in windows. When working, it's nice to have a theme that does not require attention.<br><br>
So the conclusion is that I'm excited about the possible metro theme for windows.
