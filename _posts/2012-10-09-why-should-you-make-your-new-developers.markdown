The impression I've gotten from working with ruby is that it's generally fun to work with. One of my coworkers who has about a year of experience told me:<br>
- You become happy from working with ruby.<br>
Also, for many tasks it can provide a easier experience than some of the alternatives. Consider the tasks:<br>
- Manage builds or server<br>
- Simple web app<br>
Tools like rake and sinatra are simple enough to help green developers complete the task without drowning in the complexity.<br><br>
It's the same reasoning behind webmatrix. In webmatrix there is a lot <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5953394/is-there-a-unit-testing-capability-with-webmatrix">less focus on unit testing</a>. It's aÂ slightly different perspective, but still centered around <a href="http://blog.wekeroad.com/microsoft/someone-hit-their-head">simple fun stuff</a>.
