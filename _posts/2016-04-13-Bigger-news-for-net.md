Microsoft buys Xamarin, as can be seen on [Wired](http://www.wired.com/2016/02/microsoft-expands-empire-beyond-windows-xamarin-buy/) and on [Microsoft blog](http://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2016/02/24/microsoft-to-acquire-xamarin-and-empower-more-developers-to-build-apps-on-any-device/#sm.0001xm1uqhcvaf14t9q2ju6n9cgsq).

This has some rather exciting implications. This means that it will become easier to convince people (already familiar with Microsoft products) to use Xamarin. I'm a longtime fan of [Miguel de Icaza](http://tirania.org/blog/) and the mono team and I'm happy that this technology continues to live with company backing.
