I dusted off some <a href="https://github.com/wallymathieu/skanetrafiken">old code</a> that I've written to query the API provided by <a href="http://www.labs.skanetrafiken.se/">Skånetrafiken</a>. I've also published it to <a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/skanetrafiken">rubygems</a>. It's quite nice to work with soap using ruby.
