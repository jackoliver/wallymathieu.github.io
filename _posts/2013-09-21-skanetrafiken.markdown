I dusted off some [old code](https://github.com/wallymathieu/skanetrafiken) that I've written to query the API provided by [Skånetrafiken](http://www.labs.skanetrafiken.se/). I've also published it to [rubygems](https://rubygems.org/gems/skanetrafiken). It's quite nice to work with soap using ruby.
