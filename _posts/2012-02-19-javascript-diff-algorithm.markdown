Looks like John Resig has implemented the <a href="http://ejohn.org/projects/javascript-diff-algorithm/">diff algorithm in javascript</a>. This looks quite useful. Could be valuable for client side use. There is however a <a href="https://github.com/kpdecker/jsdiff">npm package</a> that perhaps can used when analysing the code coverage information.
