It's not obvious at first thought that there are applications for generalized regular expression engines. During my career, the regular kind has been the most prevalent kind. For certain problems, there is a simple pattern matching, that regular expressions excel at. For instance, in the case when you have a matrix with relatively regular content, it can be thought of as a general type of expressions. I've created the library [Zander](https://github.com/wallymathieu/Zander) to help with that type of problem.
