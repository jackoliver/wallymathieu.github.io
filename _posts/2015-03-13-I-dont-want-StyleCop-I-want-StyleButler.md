I like lint-tools. These kind of tools help by catching things that do not work well with the language. When you write C you can really benefit from [lint](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_%28software%29), since the language has some quirks. When writing javascript you can be aided by [jshint](http://jshint.com/).

I talked to a [coworker at Tretton37](http://tretton37.com/career/meet/about/per-westerlund) about [StyleCop](https://stylecop.codeplex.com/). I get the feeling that there could probably be some better way of solving what is essentially a presentation issue. Perhaps a StyleButler that presents the code according to your StyleCop settings in the editor? This helps developers used to certain code styles to read code from a code base with a different esthetic.
