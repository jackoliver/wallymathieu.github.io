Say that you would want some microsoft plattform of the future. What would it be? Probably the Commerce Server databases in Sql Azure and an implementation of CS2009 API's by implementing the right operation sequences and dropping the old pipeline architecture.<br><br>

I wonder how much time it would take for Microsoft to implement this? It doesn't look impossible, just some grunt work getting everything in place.</div>
