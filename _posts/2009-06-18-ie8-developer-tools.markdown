<span><span>As noted in twitter IE8 has a new "developer tools" that is accessible by the key F12. Also they have included:</span></span><div><span><span>console.log</span></span></div>
<div><span><span>console.info</span></span></div>
<div><span><span>console.warn</span></span></div>
<div><span><span>console.error</span></span></div>
<div><span><span>console.assert</span></span></div>
<div> as can be seen in <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd565625%28VS.85%29.aspx">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd565625(VS.85).aspx</a>

<div><span><span>When you're debugging javascript this is really sweet. If you have seen these methods before, then it might be because you're developing in firebug <a href="http://getfirebug.com/console.html">http://getfirebug.com/console.html</a>.</span></span></div>

<span><span>IE8 is looking hot. The inclusion of Developer tools in this release of IE, developing modern javascript is easier. Before this, developing javascript without firebug was a hassle. I'm going to try to set breakpoints and such (a thing that was notoriously problematic in visual studio when you're debugging javascript). So conclusion: IE8 a great step forward for IE :)</span></span><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="line-height: 15px;font-family:Verdana;font-size:11px;"><div><span><span> </span></span></div></span></div>
