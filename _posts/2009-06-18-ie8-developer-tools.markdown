As noted in twitter and on [IE blog](http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2008/03/07/improved-productivity-through-internet-explorer-8-developer-tools.aspx) IE8 has a new "developer tools" that is accessible by the key F12. Also they have included:
 - console.log
 - console.info
 - console.warn
 - console.error
 - console.assert

as can be seen on [msdn](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd565625%28VS.85%29.aspx).

When you're debugging javascript this is really sweet. If you have seen these methods before, then it might be because you're developing in [firebug](http://getfirebug.com/console.html).

IE8 is looking hot. The inclusion of Developer tools in this release of IE, developing modern javascript is easier. Before this, developing javascript without firebug was a hassle. I'm going to try to set breakpoints and such (a thing that was notoriously problematic in visual studio when you're debugging javascript). So conclusion: IE8 a great step forward for IE.
