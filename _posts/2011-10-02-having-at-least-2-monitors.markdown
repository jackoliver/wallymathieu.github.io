Why so <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/TheSweetSpotOfMultipleMonitorProductivityThatMagicalThirdMonitor.aspx">many monitors</a>? I used to have the same kind of layout on my home computer while at the university by using X11. You have virtual desktops (not to be confused with the software) or workspaces.<br><br>
The same concept on mac os x differs significantly from how it works on linux.<br><br>
Part of the problem might be technological: When I've tried out virtual desktops on windows, the programs become extremely unstable.<br><br>
User friendly: The concept of virtual desktop is probably not very conceptually friendly for a person without a lot of experience with computers. Since power users are assumed to have enough money to buy enough big monitors.
