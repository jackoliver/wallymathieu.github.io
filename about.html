# About

## Why Assert.Fail?

   Some might find it negative. Perhaps it is. The way I use it is more like a clean slate. It's the starting point of many tests. It's a clean canvas for your implementation.

### What kind of technical person?
                     
I'm a developer working with mostly javascript, .net and databases since december 2005.

### What am I proud of?

There are lots of closed source code that I'm proud of. That code is not visible for others. 

The code that you can see that I'm proud of is for example 
  
  - [Isop](https://github.com/wallymathieu/isop). Isop has been helpful for many years when implementing console apps. The intent was to provide a controller scheme similar to asp.net MVC but without using inheritance.
  - [With](https://github.com/wallymathieu/with). With is a library where I've explored some of the possibilities of c#. I've also added helpful extensions to the library. I'm removing parts of the library as more of it is possible to do in c#. 
  - [Zander](https://github.com/fsprojects/Zander). Implementation of regular expression for matrix information. This is a reimplementation of an old idea.
