  <h2>Why Assert.Fail?</h2>
  <p>
   Some might find it negative. Perhaps it is. The way I use it is more like a clean slate. It's the starting point of many tests. It's a clean canvas for your implementation.

  <h3>What kind of technical person?</h3>
  <p>
    I'm a developer working with mostly javascript, .net and sql databases since december 2005. 
  </p>
  <h3>What am I proud of?</h3>
  <p>
    There are lots of closed source code that I'm proud of. That code is not visible for others. 
  </p>
  <p>
    The code that you can see that I'm proud of is for example <a href="https://github.com/wallymathieu/isop">Isop</a> 
    and <a href="https://github.com/wallymathieu/with">With</a>. Isop has been a workhorse for many years. 
    With is a library where I explore the possibilities of c#.
